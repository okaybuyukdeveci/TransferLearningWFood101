Transfer Learning Notebook with Food101

In this notebook, I learned how to fine-tune a pre-trained model using transfer learning. I used feature extraction with EfficientNetB0 and fine-tuned it for improved accuracy. Additionally, I applied scaling-up techniques like data augmentation to enhance the model's performance. The notebook demonstrates how to adjust the learning process by freezing layers, unfreezing others for fine-tuning, and using callbacks to save model checkpoints during training.
